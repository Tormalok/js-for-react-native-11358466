## Task 01

An array of numbers starting from 1 through 5 is passed to the function <strong>"processArray"</strong> <br>
which operates on the array by squaring the even numbers to <strong>(4 and 16)</strong> and multiplying <br>
the odd numbers by 3 to <strong>(3, 9 and 15)</strong>.

## Task 02

Two arrays are passed to the function <strong>"formatArrayStrings"</strong>, with the first array being an array <br>
of names of people which are <strong>(Carter, Stan, Homer, Jones and Webber),</strong> and with the second <br>
being that of the array of numbers that were being operated on by the <strong>"processArray"</strong> function <br>
from <strong>"Task 01"</strong>. At each name in the first array, if the corresponding value at the index in the second <br>
array is odd, then the name will be in lower case, otherwise, in upper case.

## Task 03

A sample users profile is generated from two arrays of strings with one from the formatted array <br>
of names created in <strong>"Task 02"</strong> and one being created into the function <strong>"createUserProfile"</strong> with the <br>
names <strong>(Jakes, Drake and Matts)</strong>. The profile is finally created assigning a random id to each <br>
indvidual, with each name of the first array to <strong>"originalName"</strong> and each corresponding name from <br>
the second array to <strong>"modifiedName"</strong> of each person.
